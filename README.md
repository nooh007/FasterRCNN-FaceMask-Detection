# Faster R-CNN Implementation in Pytorch

This repository implements Faster R-CNN with Resnet-50 Backbone in Pytorch.

This faster RCNN implementation can be used for any custom dataset, and make sure to follow the steps from the Tutorial to avoid any errors.

The model uses Resnet-50 by default.

To use VGG16 please rename the faster_rcnn_vgg16.py to faster_rcnn.py and faster_rcnn.py to faster_rcnn_resnet50.py Next make sure to change the backbone_out_channels to 512 for VGG16 in the voc.yaml

## Results
Achieved an mAP of 0.7531 (75%) with resnet50 backbone after 30 epochs on the facemask dataset 

## Data preparation

Please ensure that when downloading the dataset in Pascal VOC format, you place the training and testing images in their respective JPEGImages folders, and similarly, store the corresponding annotations in the Annotations folders for training and testing separately.
The Tree structure of the directory should look like the following.
FasterRCNN-Pytorch
```
     -> VOC2007
          -> JPEGImages
          -> Annotations
     -> VOC2007-test
          -> JPEGImages
          -> Annotations
     -> tools
          -> train.py
          -> infer.py
          -> train_torchvision_frcnn.py
          -> infer_torchvision_frcnn.py
     -> config
          -> voc.yaml
     -> model
          -> faster_rcnn.py
          -> faster_rcnn_vgg16.py
     -> dataset

```
